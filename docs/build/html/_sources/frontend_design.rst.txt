   * - Framework
     - Description
     - Pros
     - Cons
   * - Plain HTML
     - Traditional approach using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript without a framework.
     - - Lightweight and fast for small static pages.
       - No additional dependencies or tools required.
       - Easy to integrate with backend rendering.
       - Requires minimal learning for simple designs.
       - Suitable for very simple interfaces.
     - - Lacks scalability for complex or interactive UIs.
       - Poor reusability of components.
       - No built-in state management or dynamic routing.
       - Limited ability to handle modern app requirements without adding complexity (e.g., jQuery or vanilla JS logic).
   * - Flask
     - Python-based web framework with server-rendered templates.
     - - Python-native and integrates seamlessly with Python backends like Airflow.
       - Supports server-side rendering, making it suitable for traditional multi-page applications (MPAs).
       - Minimal setup for creating forms or simple dashboards.
       - Direct integration with backend logic.
     - - Limited support for interactive, modern UIs compared to SPAs.
       - Requires additional effort to support real-time updates or client-side state management.
       - Frontend design is tied closely to backend logic, reducing flexibility.
   * - Gradio
     - Python library for creating simple and interactive UIs, primarily for ML and data science applications.
     - - Extremely fast to set up and deploy.
       - Python-native, avoiding the need for separate frontend development expertise.
       - Great for prototyping machine learning workflows and dashboards.
       - Built-in widgets for common inputs and outputs.
     - - Limited design and customization capabilities.
       - Not suited for complex multi-page or dynamic applications.
       - Focused on ML/data applications rather than general-purpose apps.
   * - React
     - A popular JavaScript library for building interactive UI components.
     - - Component-based architecture for reusability and scalability.
       - Virtual DOM for efficient updates and performance.
       - Rich ecosystem with tools like Redux for state management.
       - Strong community support and active development.
       - Suitable for SPAs and large-scale applications.
     - - Steeper learning curve compared to simpler solutions.
       - Requires additional setup for routing and state management.
       - JSX syntax may be unfamiliar to developers used to HTML templating.
       - Can be overkill for small projects or static pages. 
   * - Vue.js
     - A modern JavaScript framework for building dynamic, interactive UIs.
     - - Provides rich interactivity and dynamic routing, making it ideal for SPAs.
       - Component-based architecture promotes reusability and scalability.
       - Supports both small projects and large-scale applications.
       - Seamlessly integrates with backend APIs for data exchange.
       - Active community and ecosystem, with plugins for routing and state management (Vue Router, Pinia).
       - Enables hot-reloading during development for efficient iteration.
     - - Requires JavaScript expertise for development.
       - Slightly more setup time compared to simpler solutions like Gradio or Flask.

**Selected Frontend Framework: Vue.js**
---------------------------------------

After evaluating the options, **Vue.js** was selected as the frontend framework for the app due to its ability to handle modern, interactive user interfaces while maintaining flexibility and scalability. The app benefits from Vue.js's rich ecosystem and seamless integration with the Python backend, making it well-suited for the application's requirements.
